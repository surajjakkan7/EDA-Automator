**1. Industry Type:
  Finance

2. Project Title:
Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Financial Services

3. Problem Statement/Opportunity:
In the finance industry, analysts spend a significant amount of time on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns, detect anomalies, and derive insights from financial data. This process is time-consuming and requires a substantial amount of manual effort. There is an opportunity to automate EDA to streamline data analysis, reduce human error, and accelerate decision-making processes.

4. Project Description:
The core idea of this project is to develop an automated EDA tool specifically tailored for the financial services industry. This tool aims to solve the problem of time-consuming and labor-intensive EDA processes by leveraging advanced Azure services and AI capabilities.

5. Core Azure Services:

Azure Synapse Analytics: For data integration, big data analytics, and data warehousing to handle large volumes of financial data.
Azure Machine Learning: To build and deploy machine learning models for anomaly detection and predictive analysis.

6. Azure AI Service:

Azure Cognitive Search: To enable robust search capabilities across various financial data sources and provide relevant insights quickly.

7. Other Azure Technologies:

Azure Data Factory: For orchestrating and automating data movement and transformation.
Azure Power BI Embedded: For creating rich, interactive visualizations and dashboards.
Azure Logic Apps: For integrating workflows and automating processes across different services.**
